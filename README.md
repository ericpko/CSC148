# CSC148: Introduction to Computer Science

### Welcome!
This repository contains some of the coursework I completed during the 
CSC148: Intro to Computer Science course at the University of Toronto,
St. George campus (UTSG). Most of the material I am posting are the
data structures and abstract data types that we implemented during
the 2018 winter semester. The professor of this course was Danny
Heap. I also combined material that was posted from the fall 2017 semester
taught by Professor's David Liu and Diane Horton.
