# CSC148: Introduction to Computer Science

### Welcome!
This repository contains some of the coursework I completed during the 
CSC148: Intro to Computer Science course at the University of Toronto,
St. George campus (UTSG). Most of the material I am posing are the
data structures and abstract data types that we implemented during
the 2018 winter semester. The professor of this course was Danny
Heap. I also combined material that was posted from the fall semester
taught by Professor David Liu and Diane Horton.

Here is a link to the [CSC148 fall semester website](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~csc148h/fall/index.html)
that I used as a guide throughout my course because of the wonderful
descriptions. You can also find some of the starter code there 
that I have implemented in this repo.

If you find any bugs/errors (which I am sure there are) please correct them,
or let me know.
