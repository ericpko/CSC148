# CSC148
Introduction to Computer Science

## Welcome!
This repository contains some of the coursework I completed during the 
CSC148: Intro to Computer Science course at the University of Toronto,
St. George campus (UTSG). Most of the material I am posing are the
data structures and abstract data types that we implemented during
the 2018 winter semester. The professor of this course was Danny
Heap. I also combined material that was posted from the fall semester
taught by Professor David Liu and Diane Horton.
